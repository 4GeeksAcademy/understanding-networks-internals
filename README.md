## üìù Instructions

### Based on the network that you build on the prework:

![intro network](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/understanding-networks-internals/blob/master/assets/network.png?raw=true)

You are a network consultant and have been hired to improve the network architecture of a small company. The company currently has a network that has grown organically over time and is experiencing performance and security issues. Your task is to assess the current situation and propose improvements. You have the following information:

### The company has the following requirements

- The network should have the capacity to grow up to 100 devices.
- The network should be divided into sub-networks for the Marketing, Technology and Accounting departments.
- The network capacity for each department is as follows:
  - Marketing: 30 devices
  - Technology: 40 devices
  - Accounting: 15 devices
  - The remaining capacity is reserved for future growth.
- Each subnet should have its own private server. Only the Technology department's server should be available to all networks.

### Questions and Challenges:

1. **Assessment of the Current Situation:** 
    - What is the extent of the current network?
    - What problems can be expected if there are no improves to the company's network?
2. **Network Topology:**
    - What network topology would you use for this company?
    - How should devices and servers be connected?
3. **Network equipment:** 
    - What type of network devices are needed (routers, switches, firewalls, etc.)?
    - What technical specifications must these devices meet?
4. Network Security:
    - What are the security measures required to protect the network?
    - How should security devices, such as firewall, be configured?
5. **Network Management:**
    - How will network devices be managed and monitored?
    - What policies should be implemented in terms of personnel to have a secure network?
    - Will a network management system (NMS) or monitoring tools be implemented?
6. **Implementation Plan:** 
    - What is the implementation schedule for the proposed enhancements?
    - How will these changes be communicated to employees?
7. **Ongoing Maintenance:** 
    - What steps will be taken to ensure ongoing network maintenance and upgrades?
    - Will security policies and incident response procedures be established?
8. **Evaluation of Success:** 
    - How will the success of the enhancements be measured? What metrics will be used to evaluate network performance and security after implementation?
    
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Remember: There are no wrong answers in terms of network topologies and devices, try to make the network as optimal as possible.**
