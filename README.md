In this scenario you'll act as the person in charge of the network in a 4Geeks Academy campus. You must complete the configurations needed in order to get the network up and running, and also implement security policies to guarantee the correct use of the internal services in the network.

This practice covers the following subjects:

1. IP Adresses
2. Setting up a DHCP server
3. Setting up a DNS server
4. WiFi networks
5. Access control list (ACL)
